<p>A chemical formula is a notation used by scientists to show the 
 number and type of atoms present in a molecule, using the atomic 
 symbols and numerical subscripts. A chemical formula is a simple 
 representation, in writing, of a three dimensional molecule 
 that exists. A chemical formula describes a substance, down to 
 the exact atoms which make it up.</p>
