enhancement,"enable imports custom ion layer in the ion layer selector of the ms-imaging viewer, data imports could be comes from a csv or xlsx table file."
enhancement,"Add tweaks of the parameters when do ms-imaging row scan raw data file combines"
fixed,"fix of the possible bug in the background R# script data backend when create the ms-imaging heatmap matrix"
enhancement,"enable set the color palette when create the ms-imaging heatmap matrix, you can just tweaks of this parameter in the [Settings] tab page on the ms-imaging heatmap matrix editor"
new,"Add a color scaler bar besides the ms-imaging viewer, you can adjust the intensity scaler range manually via this color scaler bar. This color scaler bar not working for the RGB ms-imaging render."
new,"View ion m/z distribution histogram in ms-imaging viewer. You can found this option in [MSI Analysis] -> [Feature Detections] menu."
new,"Add umap manifold + dbscan clustering for do slide sample auto-segmentation"
enhancement,"Now the umap 3d scatter viewer could interactive with the ms-imaging viewer: you can select the ms-imaging pixel spot via mouse click on the scatter point in umap 3d scatter viewer"
enhancement,"Enable the ms-imaging viewer imports the umap cluster dataset as the sample slide segmentation data source"
enhancement,"Add scatter size options for tweaks the point size when view the tissue segmentation result overlap with the ms-imaging"
update,"removes the biodeep login condition for the targetted metabolism data handler"
